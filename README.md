## What is leegfer?
Leegfer is an auto rune importer for League Of Legends and it features creating multiple rune pages and imports based on what character your playing and any matchups. 


**Note:** Due to covid and isolating im unable to work on the backend for leegfer thus me playing around with the UI aspects which is something im really weak at.

## Contribution
I accept suggetions and probably even pull requests but since this is a learning project i would appreciate it if you would explain the changes and why you have done it the way you did but don't worry if you don't want to you can still add requests and i shall just analyse it later on.

In order to contribute please look at Tauri's Docs for the setup depending on your platform. The goal is for Leegfer to be platform independent so i am not going to restrict users to Windows Only.

I am also Using Solid JS for the ui so maybe take a look at the docs for Solid JS

To begin clone the repo and cd into it and then run `yarn install`. And to actually run the application run `yarn tauri dev`.
